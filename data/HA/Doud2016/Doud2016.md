## Mutational tolerance of influenza H1 HA from A/WSN/1933 strain

[Doud and Bloom (2016)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27271655) performed deep mutational scanning on the HA from A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) influenza HA to measure the preference of each site for each amino acid under selection for viral growth in cell culture.
Here we display those results.
At a site level, we show two measures of mutational tolerance: site entropy (in bits) and number of effective amino acids.
At the mutation level, the height of each letter is proportional to the preference for that amino acid.
The data are displayed both "raw" and after re-scaling to match the stringency of selection in nature.
See the [original paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27271655) for more details; the data displayed here are available [here](https://github.com/dms-view/influenza/blob/master/data/HA/Doud2016).
