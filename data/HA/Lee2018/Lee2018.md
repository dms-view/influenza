## Mutational tolerance of influenza H3 HA from A/Perth/2009 strain

[Lee *et al.*, (2018)](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/35/E8276) performed deep mutational scanning on the HA from A/Perth/2009 (H3N2) influenza HA to measure the preference of each site for each amino acid under selection for viral growth in cell culture.
Here we display those results.

At a site level, we show two measures of mutational tolerance: site entropy (in bits) and number of effective amino acids.
We also show the corrected RMSD between the Perth09 H3 DMS and the WSN H1 DMS (as measured by [Doud and Bloom (2016)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27271655); [dms-view data](https://github.com/dms-view/influenza/blob/master/data/HA/Doud2016)).
Higher values indicate a larger distance between the two datasets.

At the mutation level, the height of each letter is proportional to the preference for that amino acid, the natural frequency of that amino acid in nature or the difference in preference between the H3 and H1 datasets (prefH3 - prefH1).

See the [original paper](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/35/E8276) for more details; the data displayed here are available [here](https://github.com/dms-view/influenza/blob/master/data/HA/Lee2018).
