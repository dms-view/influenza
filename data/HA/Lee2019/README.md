# Mutational Antigenic Profiling of Perth09 H3 HA with human and ferret sera

The paper link is [Lee _et al._, (2019)](https://elifesciences.org/articles/49324).

[4O5N_trimer.pdb](4O5N_trimer.pdb) is the crystal structure of the closely related A/Victoria/361/2011 H3N2 strain.

All of the data displayed in `dms-view` comes from the differential selection summary file [https://github.com/jbloomlab/map_flu_serum_Perth2009_H3_HA/blob/master/results/avgdiffsel/avg_sel_tidy.csv](https://github.com/jbloomlab/map_flu_serum_Perth2009_H3_HA/blob/master/results/avgdiffsel/avg_sel_tidy.csv).

The Jupyter notebook [build_data.ipynb](build_data.ipynb) reads in the above summary file and generates the data file for `dms-view`, [Lee2019.csv](Lee2019.csv).
