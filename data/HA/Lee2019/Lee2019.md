## Mutational antigenic profiling of Perth H3 HA with human and ferret sera

[Lee _et al._, (2019)](https://elifesciences.org/articles/49324) performed mutational antigenic profiling of Perth09 influenza H3 HA from human and ferret sera to measure the effect of each mutation at each site on viral escape.
Here we display those results.

At the site and mutation level we show different measures of **differential selection**, described in detail [here](https://jbloomlab.github.io/dms_tools2/diffsel.html?highlight=differential%20selection).

The site measures of differential selection include (not inclusive):

- **positive diffsel**: The sum of all positive differential selection values at a site (site level). This gives a sense to the total amount of escape/selective pressure at each site.
- **negative diffsel**: The sum of all negative differential selection values at a site (site level). This gives a sense for mutations that are depleted, rather than enriched, during serum selection relative to a non-selected control library.
- **max diffsel**: The value of the largest effect mutation (largest mutation differential selection) at each site (site level).

The mutation measures of differential selection show the differential selection measurements for individual amino acids.
